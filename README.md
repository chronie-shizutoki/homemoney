## API Documentation
The application provides a comprehensive API documentation endpoint that returns all available endpoints with descriptions in both English and Chinese.

### Accessing the API Documentation
To view the complete API documentation, start the server and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3010/api
```

or view the [api-help.json](api-help.json) file in the project root — snapshot as of 11/3/2025.

This endpoint returns a JSON response containing:
- All available API endpoints organized by category
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- English and Chinese descriptions for each endpoint
- Usage instructions for each API

### API Categories
The documentation includes endpoints for:
- Base system health checks
- Expense tracking and management
- Expense tracking and analysis
- JSON file operations
- Payment processing (donations and subscriptions)
- Data import/export functionality
- Member and subscription management
- Logging and monitoring
- Mini-application management

The API documentation is dynamically generated and will reflect any changes to the API structure.
